# fourier-series-from-path
Generate a fourier series visualization from an SVG path


# TODO List
- [ ] Multiple fourier series for multiple paths in an image
    - [ ] Might need to stagger the frequencies to avoid clutter, might not
- [ ] Clear path button
- [X] Pause sim when not tabbed in (More like correct for when it's paused)
- [ ] Move heavy processing to server-side (see if it is faster in another language)
- [ ] Draw-your-own path to visualize
- [ ] Let user pan, zoom with scroll
