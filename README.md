# fourier-series-from-path
Generate a fourier series visualization from an SVG path


# TODO List
- [] Multiple fourier series for multiple paths in an image
    - [] Might need to stagger the frequencies to avoid clutter, might not
- [] Clear path button
- [] Pause sim when not tabbed in
- [] Move heavy processing to server-side (see if it is faster in another language)
- [] Draw-your-own path to visualize
- [] Let user pan, zoom with scroll
